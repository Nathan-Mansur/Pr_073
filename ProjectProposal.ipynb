    "This question is of interest because crime happens every day, and it would be great if we can predict something about it. In this case, it would help the society as a whole if we can predict which month crime happens the most and what area crime is likely to happen. Since we all go to school in San Diego and spend most of the year here, our safety is very important and if we can help our police department allocate their resources to reduce crime, it will help everyone in the long run. One piece of background information that led to our hypothesis of the most crimes occurring in June is because in 2014, offenses during the summer increased by an average of 4% and violent crimes during the summer increased by an average of 17%. Since San Diego has wonderful weather and enjoyable attractions all over the county, tourists are more prone to crimes like theft or assault, which is why we predicted the County Sherrif’s area to have the most crimes as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, the police department is facing a shortage of officers. It is projected that by July 2017, we will have 1,800 less officers. On top of that, funding is decreasing for the department. With these constraints, it is important to manage officer resources more efficiently since they do not have the manpower or resources to combat crime. By using the data to track specific hotbeds of crime at a certain time, police officers can focus their attention on that specific area and pull resources away from areas where there is less crime (but of course they should not reveal that). We can also distinguish which crime costs the city the most. If we wanted to focus on the most expensive crime, we can figure out the area and time where it occurs and prevent them. This would overall lower the cost of crime to the city, which then they can invest the saved money in other areas, like the police department.\n",

We make a separate graph comparing the month with the highest crime rate from each region to all the other regions. From then we can conclude what month has the most crimes and where it occurs. We evaluate the validity of our hypothesis against the conclusion our data has made. For the second part of our hypothesis, we take a look at the costs of the crime. We do this by taking the total of each crime throughout all San Diego and calculating the cost of crime using the current crime costs of Los Angeles. From here, we make a graph and see if the costs correlate with the amount of crimes we analyzed before.\n",

    "One potential pitfall in our data analysis is when we are computing the cost of cries because we are planning on using the crime costs from Los Angeles. We do not have access to the specific San Diego crime costs, especially within the past nine years, though we believe that the costs from Los Angeles is similar to that of San Diego. Therefore, the pricing of crimes in San Diego may be an overestimation which can affect how the San Diego Police Department handles these crimes in terms of handling resources. Additionally, not all crime that has occurred in San Diego has been reported. Certain crimes, like sexual assault or theft, may go unreported because the victim feels like the offense is not worth the hassle of filing a report. There is also the possibility of human error when the police department processes these reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "If our hypothesis is wrong, we would gain an insight as to what is actually happening in the San Diego area. Our preconceived notions would be adjusted to reflect the data in order to carry through with a conclusion. Having a wrong hypothesis would be a welcome sight, because that means we discovered something that was against a popular thought among our members. If our methods do not work, we may need to hone in on specific areas in the county. This is because a county is still a large geographical area to cover, so there may be a hotbed of crime in an isolated area inside the county. \n"
